      <h2>Welcome to the den</h2>
      <p>This is a minimalist corner of the web inspired by the tranquil Bear Blog aesthetic. It keeps things light, fast, and focused on thoughtful writing. The whole site is a handful of plain files, which means you can host it anywhere&mdash;including GitHub Pages.</p>
      <p>Use this as a starting point for your own stories, field notes, and experiments. Publish a new post by duplicating one of the examples inside the <code>posts/</code> folder and updating the metadata. The navigation updates instantly because the site is static&mdash;nothing to recompile.</p>
