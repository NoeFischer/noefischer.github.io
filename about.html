      <h2>About the human behind the bear</h2>
      <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m the keeper of this tiny den on the internet. I believe in calm, handcrafted websites and writing that gives you time to breathe. This template was put together so I could share notes on design, hiking, and intentional technology&mdash;but you can adapt it to whatever you care about most.</p>

      <p>Swap this text for your own story. Let readers know what you&rsquo;re exploring, the projects you&rsquo;re proud of, and where they can find you elsewhere on the web. If you want a contact section, add a simple list of links or an email button below.</p>
      <p>Because the site is static, there&rsquo;s no database, tracking scripts, or superfluous animation. Just words, photos, and a little CSS. That means your visitors get the content immediately without distractions.</p>
