      <h1>Morning Trails</h1>
      <time datetime="2024-03-03">March 3, 2024</time>
      <p>The morning starts with mist curling over the ridgeline. Bears aren&rsquo;t awake yet, but the forest already hums&mdash;pines exhaling, creek water stitching its way downhill. I follow the switchbacks slowly, shoes crunching over frost and last season&rsquo;s leaves.</p>
      <p>Halfway up, I unpack a small thermos of tea and a notebook. Thirty minutes of silence becomes a page of quick sketches: the shape of a distant peak, the sharp breath in my chest, the shadows sliding down the valley. Slowness doesn&rsquo;t fight progress; it just measures it differently.</p>
      <p>By the time the sun clears the trees, the trail glows copper. I close the notebook, tuck it in my pack, and head home with fresh ideas for future posts. This site is a record of those tiny moments&mdash;a reminder that consistent walks outside keep the writing honest.</p>
