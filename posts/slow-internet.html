      <h1>Slow Internet, Soft Mind</h1>
      <time datetime="2024-05-18">May 18, 2024</time>
      <p>When everything on the web is tuned for speed, it can feel strange to intentionally slow down. Yet the quiet corners may be where your best ideas live&mdash;far from autoplay videos, algorithmic feeds, and inbox badges. A slower internet makes space for the kind of wandering that writing craves.</p>
      <p>The philosophy behind Bear Blog is to default to less: fewer colors, fewer scripts, fewer distractions. Every byte you remove is an invitation to concentrate. The page you are reading now is pure HTML and CSS served from a static host. That simplicity keeps the lighthouse score perfect and the DOM easy to understand.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;The secret to creativity is subtracting the noise until the signal feels inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Try it for yourself: pause notifications, swap your phone for a notebook, and draft your next post offline. When you come back, publishing is as easy as copying a file into the <code>posts/</code> folder and linking to it from the index. The workflow rewards focus instead of frantic multitasking.</p>
      <p>May your internet be intentionally quiet, and your mind pleasantly soft.</p>
